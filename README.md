Investor Education and Protection Fund guidelines for collecting overdue amounts and shares (IEPF) and IEPF Claim Shares

The Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF), formed by the Central Government under section 125 of the Companies Act, 2013, outlines the idea and method for collecting unpaid payments and shares (the Act). While preparing these guidelines, we only considered dividend and equity share claims; however, under the Act, any person whose shares, unclaimed dividends, matured deposits, matured debentures, application money due for refund, or interest thereon, sale proceeds of fractional shares, redemption proceeds of preference shares, or other property has been transferred to the Fund may claim the shares under the provisions of sub-section (6) of section 124 or apply for a refund under section 124.


Procedure For IEPF claim shares

The person whose name any amount/share has been transferred to the IEPF (shares from iepf) can apply online to the Authority established by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs in Form IEPF-5, which is available on the website www.iepf.gov.in, along with the cost prescribed by the Authority.

The claimant must submit an application in Form IEPF-5, duly signed by him, together with the required papers listed below, to the company's Nodal Officer (iepf claim shares) at its registered office in an envelope labelled "claim for a refund from IEPF Authority" to begin the verification of his claim.
